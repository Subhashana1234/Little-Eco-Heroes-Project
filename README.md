Little Eco Heroes is a gamified awareness project designed to address two critical global challenges: planetary health degradation and mobile game addiction among teenagers.

The project introduces a story-driven mobile game concept that engages teenagers through interactive levels such as Home, School, Garden, Town, Country, and World. As players progress, they earn rewards by completing eco-friendly missions, learning sustainable practices, and understanding real-world environmental responsibilities. The goal is to redirect excessive mobile gaming habits into meaningful learning experiences while promoting environmental consciousness.

To support evidence-based design, we developed a data-driven dashboard using global datasets to analyze mobile gaming behavior among children aged 10–18, including gaming hours, sleep patterns, motivations, and age-group trends. These insights guided the game mechanics and awareness strategies.

The project combines game design, data analytics, and sustainability education, aiming to reduce unhealthy gaming patterns while empowering teenagers to become responsible digital citizens and future environmental stewards.
